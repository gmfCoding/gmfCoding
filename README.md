# Hello, welcome!

My GitHub is a mess but it's my lovely mess, I have some projects that are semi-permamently-inactive.

My interest in programming began in 2013 and I have been learning to code since, from starting with Minecraft-modding to Java then moving to C# console applications and discovering Unity Game Engine, making some bad 3D games to then getting more interested with the lower-level languages like C and C++.

Other passions of mine are 3D Digital Art and CGI, VFX, Video editing, Electronics, Maths
 and much much more.

Previous mentionable projects:
- [cub3D](https://github.com/gmfCoding/cubed)
- [nand-game assembler](https://github.com/gmfCoding/Nandgame-Assembler)
- [FConsole](https://github.com/gmfCoding/FConsole)
- [game-engine](https://github.com/gmfCoding/openengine)
- [minecraft clone](https://github.com/gmfCoding/minecraft-clone)
- Various games and apps
