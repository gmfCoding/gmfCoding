# Hello, welcome!

My GitHub is a mess but it's my lovely mess, I have some projects that are semi-permamently-inactive.

My interest in programming began in 2013 and I have been learning to code since then, from starting with minecraft-modding to Java then moving to C# console applications and discovering Unity game engine, making some bad 3D games to then getting more interested with the lower-level languages like C++ and C, I'd say I've collected quite a bit of interest and knowledge that I well most of the time fail to apply to my projects.

Other passions of mine are 3D Digital Art and CGI, VFX, Video editing, Electronics, Maths
 and much much more.
Albeit some of these passions have been neglected nevertheless they still exist.

I am currently enrolled at: 42 Adelaide

Current Project: Learning Docker, WebAssembly and WebGL
